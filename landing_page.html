                        <h2> Algorithm </h2>
                        <p>The Pied Piper algorithm from the show Silicon Valley is a video compression software program written in C that achieves a Weissman score in the fives. This type of video compression technology is said to be able to actually shrink the internet by as much as 10 percent with widespread adoption.</p>
                        <p>Created by the team of main characters, led by CEO Richard Hendricks and software developers Bertram Gilfoyle and Dinesh Chugtai, the pied piper algorithm was considered revolutionary enough, that the company won TechCrunch Disrupt and a $50,000 prize.</p>

                        <h2>Piper Chat</h2>
                        <p>Whilst the team was creating the platform Dinesh Chugtai uses the teams algorithm to hack together a new Video chat platform based around Hoolichat. His motive for creating Piper chat was to improve the image quality of Elizabet Kirsipuu video chat image since her image was poor quality due to her low internet connection. The team share invites to the platform with their friends who pass it along to others and the video chat soon proves to be popular. After the platform fails to get investors the team instead more the company focus to the video chat platform.</p>

                        <p>The box was a Pied Piper product. The idea of it was developed by Richard by accident using it as an example of what not to do. Furthermore Jack Barker insisted in its development until he was fired. Later when Jack started working at Hooli where the box was redeveloped netting the company a fortune.</p>
